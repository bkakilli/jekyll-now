I am a programming enthusiast electrical engineer. I often call myself "Maxwell/Fourier-aware coder". I usually prefer Linux as development environment but can't give up the beauty of Visual Studio. I also like to mess with hardware and embedded systems. Check my Garden Automation System project, which is a really simplistic bluetooth watering and lighting automation with bluetooth control for small gardens. I have a little VHDL experience.
