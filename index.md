I'm currently doing my Ph.D on Electrical and Computer Engineering at Syracuse University. I work with [Dr. Senem Velipasalar](http://ecs.syr.edu/faculty/velipasalar/index.htm) in her [Smart Vision Systems](http://www.vision.syr.edu/) group. My main research interests are 3D computer vision and deep learning. I'm also interested in machine intelligence and embedded systems.
I enjoy coding. Other than nerd stuff, I do have hobies.

### Conference Papers
- Heat Leakage Detection from Thermal Images for Autonomous Aerial Building Inspection (2017) (Under Revision)
- Autonomous altitude measurement and landing area detection for indoor UAV applications (2016) [[paper]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7738069) [code]
- Doorway detection for autonomous indoor navigation of unmanned vehicles (2016) [[paper]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7533078) [code]

#### Upcoming
- 3D SSD: SSD detector for 3D voxel grid scenes (expected to submit to CVPR 2018)
- 3D vision based autonomous guidance of indoor UAVs using smartphone

### Project highlights
- 3D object detection via multi-modal sensor fusion from autonomous UAVs
- 3D vision based autonomous drone guidance framework
- Thermal anomaly inspection of the building envelopes using autonomous UAVs
- [see others]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects)

### Skills
#### Coding
- I code fluently in **Python**, **C/C++**, and **Matlab**.
- I involved in quite some projects written in **Java (plus Android)**, **C#**, and **Assembly** other than above.
- I have some experience with **VHDL**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, **SQL**, **CSS** other than above.

#### Tools and APIs
- I use **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **OpenCV**, **PCL**.

#### Hardware
- I enjoy doing stuff with **Raspberry Pi**. I use it as my primary embedded prototyping suite. For computationally demanding applications I prefer Nvidia's **Jetson**. I am working with **Pixhawk** flight controller in my current project.
- I have done projects with **Arduino** and **ATMega** chips.
- I am familiar with Xilinx **FPGA** prodcuts and hardware development.

### Career highlights
- (2015) Started Ph.D in ECE, Syracuse Univeristy.
- (2015) Bachelor degree from Bilkent University, EE.
- (2010) Tuition scholarship at Bilkent University.
- (2010) 99.9 percentile ranking in national university entrance exam.
